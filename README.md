# Soft_Computing_Project
Development and Training of an Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation for Predictive Modeling on Sample Data.
– Developed and trained a neural network with an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
– Implemented sigmoid activation functions and applied min-max scaling for data normalization.
– Conducted backpropagation with mean squared error optimization.
– Evaluated model predictions against target values.
