# Soft_Computing_Project
Development and Training of an Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation for Predictive Modeling on Sample Data.

Developed a neural network with 3 input neurons, 10,000 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron, using forward propagation, backpropagation, and mean squared error for training.

Implemented sigmoid activation functions and their derivatives for network computations.

Normalized input data using min-max scaling to enhance model performance.

Applied L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Trained the network over 500 iterations with a learning rate of 0.4, and plotted the mean squared error to visualize convergence.

Conducted testing by evaluating model predictions against target values, providing insights into the network's performance.
